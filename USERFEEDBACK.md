> User Feedback: Acclimate is super cool! I could see myself using this to make sure Iâ€™m prepared for natural disasters in the future. The design is clean, and the app is easy and intuitive to use, with great features and functionality

4. Renata Dickinson, classmate
> User Feedback: I should be able to understand what the lists are for/I should be able to see an instructions page
* Action: Added tooltips to buttons/icons with no labels
* Action: Added a help page
* Action: When a new user logs in for the first time, he or she is redirected to the help page

> User Feedback: Add further username validation (spaces not allowed anywhere) on sign up
* Action: Added simple username validation on client side which checks for spaces as user types

> User Feedback: Implement XSS
* Action: Implemented simple sanitation methods on data being returned to cient side

5. Wesley Rou, classmate
> There is a lot of white on white on white. Maybe a pastel palette would help pop the components out even more
* Action: 

> The little face on the landing page is cute, but there's a lot of white space to the right of it. I wonder whether it should go up above to the left of the app name
* Action: 

> After login, I get navigated to the empty dashboard. Maybe after registration, login automatically and then redirect to the search page to bypass the step where a first time user has to navigate to the search manually
* Action: When a new user logs in for the first the time, he or she is redirected to the help page

> Visually I like the buttons, but I think you lost a fair bit of clarity on what some of them do (specifically, I clicked on the + button on the task list 10 times before realizing that it was to add an entry into the list because I thought it was going to generate a list for me like it says in the instructions)
* Action: Added tooltips to buttons onhover to clear ambiguity
